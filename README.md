shmapes. is a minimalist 2D bullet-hell arena shooter prototype made with Godot 4.4. This is my personal learning project and the first game i´ve ever tried to make (Besides the ones which you can find in courses). The entire game is built using geometric shapes and 
I´ll try to do my best to focus on polished, clean gameplay with good input feedback.
